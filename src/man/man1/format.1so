.SH FORMAT OPTIONS
Choose the representation of the 1-wire unique identifiers. OWFS uses these identifiers as unique directory names.
.PP
Although several display formats are selectable, all must be in 
.I family-id-crc8
form, unlike some other programs and the labelling on iButtons, which are
.I crc8-id-family
form.
.SS \-f \-\-format="f[.]i[[.]c]"
Display format for the 1-wire devices. Each device has a 8byte address, consisting of:
.TP
.I f
family code, 1 byte
.TP
.I i
ID number, 6 bytes
.TP
.I c
CRC checksum, 1 byte
.PP
Possible formats are
.I f.i
(default, 01.A1B2C3D4E5F6),
.I fi fic f.ic f.i.c
and
.I fi.c
.PP
All formats are accepted as input, but the output will be in the specified format.
.PP
The address elements can be retrieved from a device entry in owfs by the 
.I family, id and crc8
properties, and as a whole with
.I address.
The reversed id and address can be retrieved as
.I r_id
and 
.I r_address.
