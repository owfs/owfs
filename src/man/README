** Layout

All man pages are stored in their respective section directories: man{1,3,5,n}.

File extensions:

.man                   : man page sources
.1so, .3so, .5so, .nso : files to be included via .so requests
.1 .3 .5 .n            : man pages that point to an existing man page via a
                         single .so request

** Operation:

'make' will run 'soelim' to build complete man pages (with the correct
'.1' up to '.n' externsion) form '.man' sources

'make install' will install the buit man pages.

If 'soelim' is not available, 'make install' will simply rename '.man' files
to the correct man section extension ('.1' '.3' '.5' '.n') and install
them along with '.*so' files.


** Notes

According to man conventions, all .so requests must be relative to the
parent 'man' directory, e.g.
'.so man1/seealso.1so'

To read a man page before installation one can run from the parent directory:

'man -M . owserver' (if soelim has already been run)
or
'man -l man1/owserver.man'
