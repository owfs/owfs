.I read-write, binary
.br
32704 bytes of memory. Possibly protected by a password.
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.510 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 511 pages of 64 bytes each.
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS set_number/full set_number/read
.I write-only, ascii
.br
Passwords entered as numbers, either decimal, or hex of form 0x0123456789ABCDEF. Handled the same as
.I set_password/xxx

.I read-write, yes-no
.br
Turn on/off password protection for the DS1977, or return the current state.
.SS set_password/full set_password/read
.I write-only, binary
.br
Passwords (8 byte values) that allow read or full access to the DS1977 memory. The password set by
.I set_password/xxx
are stored in the DS1977 and locally in the program as well (as if
.I use_password/xxx
was also called).
.SS use_password/full use_password/read
.I write-only, binary

Passwords (8 byte values) that allow read or full access to the DS1977 memory. The password set by
.I use_password/xxx
are stored in the program and must match the passwords stored in the DS1977. Changing the DS1977 passwords using
.I set_password/xxx
will change these values as well.
