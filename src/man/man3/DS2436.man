.SH FAMILY CODE
.PP
.I 1B
.SH SPECIAL PROPERTIES
.SS pages/page.0 ... pages/page.4 pages/page.ALL
.I read-write, binary
.br
Memory is split into 5 pages of 32 bytes each. Only the first 3 pages are really available, and some of that appears to be reserved. See the datasheet for details.
.P
.I pages/page.0 
is locked and unlocked transparently for every write.
.P
.I ALL
is an aggregate of the pages. Each page is accessed sequentially.
.SS temperature
.I read-only, floating point
.br
.I Temperature
read by the chip at high resolution (~13 bits). Units are selected from the invoking command line. See
.B owfs(1)
or
.B owhttpd(1)
for choices. Default is Celsius.
Conversion takes ~20 msec.
.SS volts
.I read-only, floating point
.br
Voltage read (~10 bits) at the chip's supply voltage Vdd. Range 2.4V to 10V.
.SS counter/
A resettable non-volatile counter intended for counting battery discharge cycles.
.SS counter/cycles
.I read-only, unsigned integer
.br
Cycle counter value. Stored at memory location 0x82.
.SS counter/increment
.I write-only, yes/no
.br
Any non-zero (true) value will increment
.I counter/cycles
by one.
.SS counter/reset
.I write-only, yes/no
.br
Any non-zero (true) value will reset
.I counter/cycles
to zero.
.SH STANDARD PROPERTIES
.so man3/standard.3so
.SH ALARMS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.so man3/description.3so
.SS DS2436
The
.B DS2436 (3)
is a simpler form of the
.B DS2438
battery chip. It has no counter, and only one voltage sensor.
