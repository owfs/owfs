.SS enable_read
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Show read ability for this sections 1=enable or 0=disable read. This is almost always =1, but during measurment may be set to 0.
One means ready for read, but during new measurment may be set to zero for prevent read bat value.
.SS enable_write
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Show write ability for this sections 1=enable or 0=disable write. If section not have this avility, then write new value has no efecet.
.SS give_alarm
.I read-only, yes-no
.br
Show alarm ability for this sections 1=have or 0=no have alarm. If section not have alarm, tahn min/max alarm have no effect.
.SS max_alarm_value
.I read-write, integer point
.br
Value for max alarm boundary. If section no have alarm ability or is not set property enable_max_alarm, then this has no effect.

.SS address
.SS r_address
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The entire 64-bit unique ID. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.br
.I address
starts with the
.I family
code
.br
.I r address
is the
.I address
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.SS crc8
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit error correction portion. Uses cyclic redundancy check. Computed from the preceding 56 bits of the unique ID number. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS family
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 8-bit family code. Unique to each
.I type
of device. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.SS id
.SS r_id
.I read-only, ascii
.br
The 48-bit middle portion of the unique ID number. Does not include the family code or CRC. Given as upper case hexadecimal digits (0-9A-F).
.br
.I r id
is the
.I id
in reverse order, which is often used in other applications and labeling.
.SS locator
.SS r_locator
.I read-only, ascii
.br
Uses an extension of the 1-wire design from iButtonLink company that associated 1-wire physical connections with a unique 1-wire code. If the connection is behind a
.B Link Locator
the
.I locator will show a unique 8-byte number (16 character hexadecimal) starting with family code FE.
.br
If no
.B Link Locator
is between the device and the master, the
.I locator
field will be all FF.
.br
.I r locator
is the
.I locator
in reverse order.

.I present
on the 1-wire bus?
.SS type
.I read-only, ascii
.br

.SS 1-Wire
.I 1-wire 
is a wiring protocol and series of devices designed and manufactured
by Dallas Semiconductor, Inc. The bus is a low-power low-speed low-connector
scheme where the data line can also provide power.
.PP
Each device is uniquely and unalterably numbered during manufacture. There are a wide variety
of devices, including memory, sensors (humidity, temperature, voltage,
contact, current), switches, timers and data loggers. More complex devices (like
thermocouple sensors) can be built with these basic devices. There are also
1-wire devices that have encryption included.
.PP
The 1-wire scheme uses a single 
.I bus master
and multiple
.I slaves
on the same wire. The bus master initiates all communication. The slaves can be 
individually discovered and addressed using their unique ID.
.PP
Bus masters come in a variety of configurations including serial, parallel, i2c, network or USB
adapters.
.SS OWFS design
.I OWFS
is a suite of programs that designed to make the 1-wire bus and its
devices easily accessible. The underlying principle is to create a virtual
filesystem, with the unique ID being the directory, and the individual
properties of the device are represented as simple files that can be read and written.
.PP 
Details of the individual slave or master design are hidden behind a consistent interface. The goal is to 
provide an easy set of tools for a software designer to create monitoring or control applications. There 
are some performance enhancements in the implementation, including data caching, parallel access to bus 
masters, and aggregation of device communication. Still the fundamental goal has been ease of use, flexibility
and correctness rather than speed.
.SS Seahu_CD
The
.B Seahu_CD (3)
is multisenor/actor device based on arduino 1-Wire slave library. Every sensor/actor has own section aviable as sub directory.

All 1-wire devices are factory assigned a unique 64-bit address. This address is of the form:
.TP
.B Family Code
8 bits
.TP
.B Address
48 bits
.TP
.B CRC
8 bits
.IP
.PP
Addressing under OWFS is in hexadecimal, of form:
.IP
.B 01.123456789ABC
.PP
where
.B 01
is an example 8-bit family code, and
.B 12345678ABC
is an example 48 bit address.
.PP
The dot is optional, and the CRC code can included. If included, it must be correct.
