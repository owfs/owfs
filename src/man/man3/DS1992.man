The
.B DS1992 (3)
is an iButton with static memory. Data is read/written with error checking (transparent to the user).
The
.B DS1992 (3)
,
.B DS1993 (3)
,
.B DS1995 (3)
, and
.B DS1996 (3)
differ in their function by the amount of on-board memory they possess. (The internal protocols are slightly different, but the
.I OWFS
system handles this automatically.)
