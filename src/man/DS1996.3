.SS DS1996
The
.B DS1996 (3)
is an iButton with static memory. Data is read/written with error checking (transparent to the user).
The
.B DS1992
,
.B DS1993
,
.B DS1995
, and
.B DS1996
differ in their function by the amount of on-board memory they possess. (The internal protocols are slightly different, but the
.I OWFS
system handles this automatically.)
