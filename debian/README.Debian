1wire / owfs for Debian
-----------------------

I decided to name the package "1wire" instead of Upstream's "owfs"
because, frankly, that's what it does -- drive 1wire buses.

owfs aka one wire file system is just a small part of this; in fact,
most "real" applications will not use the file system at all: it's SLOW.
