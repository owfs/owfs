OWNet version 1.10
==================

OWNet is a light-weight module for accessing owserver. 

The overall goal is an easy way to use the 1-Wire bus and devices. Useful
for monitoring, security, hobby, control. (Projects include weather 
monitoring, heating and cooling control, aquarium, tractor, motorcycle,
swimming pool and others.)

The full explanation can be found at http://www.owfs.org

Basically 1-Wire is a simple and inexpensive way to connect chips made
by Dallas Semicondictor to a computer. These chips each have a unique
ID, and are individually addressable, even with a bus that has only a
combined power/data line and ground.

The underlying idea of OWFS (One Wire File System) is to make the whole
1-wire bus look like a file system. Devices are directories (named by
their unique ID) and their properties (memory, contact, voltage, 
temperature,...) are files.

owserver is one of the OWFS programs that connects and virtuallizes the
1-wire bus. It communicates via a well-documented tcp/ip protocol,
see: http://www.owfs.org/index.php?page=owserver-protocol

OWNet is a perl module to connect to a owserver process.
There are four methods: read, write, dir, present
All that's needed is the ip address of the owserver, and the "path"
-- unique name or the 1-wire resource wanted.

---------------

OWNet is pure perl. It uses the IO::Socket::INET module for tcp/ip
communication.

It should be usable on any system with perl, and a network stack.
