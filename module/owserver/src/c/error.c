/* owserver -- responds to requests over a network socket, and processes them on the 1-wire bus/
         Basic idea: control the 1-wire bus and answer queries over a network socket
         Clients can be owperl, owfs, owhttpd, etc...
         Clients can be local or remote
                 Eventually will also allow bounce servers.

         syntax:
                 owserver
                 -u (usb)
                 -d /dev/ttyS1 (serial)
                 -p tcp port
                 e.g. 3001 or 10.183.180.101:3001 or /tmp/1wire
